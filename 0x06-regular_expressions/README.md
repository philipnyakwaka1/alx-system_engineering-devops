# Regular Expressions (Regex)

Regular expressions, often abbreviated as "regex" or "regexp," are a powerful tool for pattern matching and text manipulation in programming and text processing tasks.

## What is a Regular Expression?

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It can be used to match, search, replace, or extract specific pieces of text within a larger text or data set. Regular expressions are highly flexible and can match a wide range of patterns, from simple strings to complex patterns.

## Basic Syntax

- **Literals:** Regular expressions can include literal characters that match themselves (e.g., `abc` matches the string "abc" in the input text).

- **Metacharacters:** Metacharacters are special characters with reserved meanings. Some common metacharacters include `.` (matches any character), `*` (matches zero or more of the preceding element), `+` (matches one or more of the preceding element), `?` (matches zero or one of the preceding element), and more.

- **Character Classes:** Character classes allow you to specify sets or ranges of characters to match (e.g., `[a-zA-Z]` matches any uppercase or lowercase letter).

## Examples

### Matching an Email Address

```regex
/[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,4}/
This regular expression matches a typical email address.

Extracting Phone Numbers

/\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}/
This regular expression matches phone numbers in the format "###-##-####."

Tools
Several tools and libraries are available for working with regular expressions, including:

Programming Languages: Most programming languages have built-in support for regular expressions, such as Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and more.

Text Editors: Many text editors, like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Notepad++, offer regex search and replace functionality.

Online Regex Testers: Websites like regex101.com and regexr.com allow you to test and experiment with regular expressions interactively.

Learning Resources
If you're new to regular expressions, here are some resources to get started:

Regex101: An interactive online regex tester and debugger.
